### Spark Prophecy (I)
Binance will seize the stock exchange in several steps and then seize the voice of the entire financial system:

① Like *synthetix* and *mirror*, it uses a basket of crypto currency ratios (similar to CDR) for "over-collateralization", maps real-world stocks (such as bTSLA), uses algorithms to automatically set prices and dynamically adjusts the value of collateral. So people who buy bTSLA are not buying air.

② Allow real-world stock holders to obtain shares issued by Binance through pledge (e.g. pledge TSLA for bTSLA)

③ Because Binance holds real TSLA stocks, Binance can also gradually allow bTSLA holders to exchange for real-world TSLA within a controllable amount.

④ After completing ② and ③, due to the characteristics of 24-hour transactions without intermediaries and manual intervention in the blockchain field, the pricing power and pegging mechanism will gradually change from TSLA-led to bTSLA-led. Hedge funds are forced to split positions to bTSLA to stabilize and share risks.

⑤ After completing the first interconnection between the real world and the virtual currency world, Binance copied the approach to stocks with large trading volumes, such as FANMG.

⑥ After the demonstration effect, Binance allows non-listed companies to directly IPO on Binance. After that, there will be no NYSE, Nasdaq, or Hong Kong Stock Exchange anymore, and the A shares are not worth mentioning.

The listing of Coinbase on Nasdaq today is only the result of some people in the blockchain world being recruited by the mainstream world. The real Native Blockchainer is disdainful to integrate into the existing old ones and are all vested interest groups and establishments. Of the financial system.

In fact, they have already completed the construction of the new world, don't you see that GrayScale's management scale has reached 50 billion US dollars, and the DCG behind it is even bigger. It's just that the people in the traditional circle are still turning a blind eye.

The elephant in the room could not be seen by anyone, or the eyes were moved to the side and deliberately not to look at it, so that the time has been quiet and good.

One day, these people will be trampled to death by the elephant in the room.


### Spark Prophecy (II)
What will the world look like in 10 years? I think about it boldly.

Driverless should be popular, so the Didi(Chinese Uber) drivers who greet me every day should be unemployed. I don’t know what they will do. An autonomous driving platform-level company will be born, which is responsible for automatically deploying vehicles and controlling the driving of various vehicles. As a result, the road becomes smooth, and the time from point to point in the city will be rapidly shortened. This led to an increase in the price of the remaining land and houses around the city, because it used to take an hour and a half to get there because of traffic jams, but now it only takes 50 minutes. Based on this transportation platform company, automakers are either integrated into the platform; or they provide personalized vehicles to complete the differentiation of driving scenarios. The interior of the self-driving car feels like a small room or a small meeting room, which can drive smoothly and can be used for entertainment and office work. It has a big screen and good sound.

In the 10-year cycle, we should not see the takeaway brother and the courier brother. Drones and robot dogs should replace most of the urban express delivery jobs. If you don't believe it, you can look at the decline of Boston Dynamics robots in 2010 and think about what they have become in 2020. Think about what they will become in 2030. 

People in the blockchain field really don't believe in human beings. They only believe in codes and machines controlled by codes. So you can't persuade a blockchain giant to hire a human bodyguard or human nanny. Small drone security companies have also appeared very early. Their drones are about the size of a palm or even smaller, but they can be clusters of 20 to 30 around people, and they can fly in very complex formations. And conduct both defensive and offensive operations at the same time. These security companies often accept payment in digital currency with anonymous addresses, and have services on standby at any time. There are tarmacs in various parts of the city. Small shuttles are extremely fast, and although they also carry weapons, attacking by impact seems to be the most effective and quickest way to end the battle.

Because the efficiency of drones is so much higher, the government compromised to open up the sky. The city needs to re-plan the sky network to ensure the normal operation of drones, and put a protective layer on the living areas of important buildings and office areas to prevent drones from falling and hurting people. Of course, the drone itself has made great progress in the past 10 years. At the very least, it is safer to fly or "sound".

Of course, commuting to work is no longer the first choice. You can also not go to work in the company, but it is better than working in the company. The 3D holographic projection on your glasses or contact lenses and the desktop can make you feel that you and your colleagues are more realistic. Working together, everyone can easily enter the same environment and atmosphere. If you need it, you can buy skin or rejuvenation filters, at least so that you can maintain your 30-year-old body condition for a long time. Some children like to use virtual identities and avatars to appear in the workplace, if the company allows it.

The company's daily check-in step is to find a way to confirm that you are "you", and it is necessary to associate the avatar and yourself on the biological characteristics. Otherwise, there will always be cases of other human labor and artificial intelligence foundry.

Of course, the company may not be a company anymore, it may be just a community or a team. Come and go at any time, everyone is assigned according to work, and everyone's contribution is clarified through the algorithm. The goal of most companies and organizations is to develop a distributed program or function, based on the blockchain as the underlying infrastructure: there is no specific server, no specific storage bandwidth and calculation. AWS has long ceased to exist, and has been replaced by ETH (computing), FIL (storage), THETA (bandwidth) and their derivatives.

There is no so-called major shareholder or company boss who is the biggest beneficiary of the developed functions and programs. As long as the people who participate in the network contribute, they will benefit from the development of the network itself. Any content, even if it is not the head, will be rewarded as long as it makes a small contribution to the development and expansion of the network, and many people use it to make a living.

Users are shareholders, and no software will force users to surrender their data to advertise this spam business model. Users either pay a monthly fee to buy the feature, or they contribute content and value to the network to get rewards to deduct the monthly fee. The community itself encourages this behavior.

Everyone knows that their data is sacred and inviolable, just as sacred as private property defined in the decree 200 years ago. After all, this is the only evidence that you are "you" in the cyberspace.

### Spark Prophecy (III)
No one's money is stored in the bank. Once again, we are back to knowing that "my money is mine", which truly belongs to my state of affirmation.

Unless someone used magic or Veritaserum on me and I leaked the private key, I would not tell the private key in my mind even if I was forced to do so. The money is there, it's "mine", and no one can take it away. And most people don't actually know that I have the money.

The efficiency of the blockchain has increased 1,000 times in a 10-year cycle. The original one-minute transaction is now completed in 0.06 seconds. So you can complete the quick transfer and confirmation operations. Not only benefited from the improvement of algorithms and data structure, but also benefited from the continuous advancement of chip technology to improve computing efficiency, and the improvement of storage and transmission is also indispensable.

We can easily borrow, mortgage, and trade assets without the need for manual intermediaries. Most of the contracts are established in smart contracts.

From the first grade, we not only require children to learn English, but also to learn programming. Otherwise, we don’t even know how to sign contracts with others in society. If you can't read the code, you can only get pitted, just like the illiterate of the old age.

Our children do not seem to have to go to school. After all, all human knowledge bases existed on the Internet for a long time. With a little guidance from teachers, everyone can learn the knowledge they need more easily and conveniently.

In the financial world, there is no information gap between people. Most of the good ideas are known to everyone in the first round of financing, so getting investment opportunities is not as simple as bidding. More people are selected as investors because they really understand what the project and the community have to do, and they can help. Many people bid, and large and small funds can participate. The IPO of the project happened from the first day, and after that, everyone gathered firewood and the fire was high. Regarding the daily cash flow of the team, the regulatory investors know that a good team needs to go through many temptations, tribulations and tests.

### Spark Prophecy (IV)
Humans have established a test version of the Mars colony base, but more importantly, before that, the moon base has been completed.

Our ability to reach Mars for exploration does not mean that the first extraterrestrial base was built on Mars.

Asteroid mining has become commonplace, and all kinds of rare metals that are not available on the earth have bid farewell to shortages.

The version of Mars Colony One undoubtedly belonged to Musk. It was soon discovered that the various technologies that Musk had developed and studied ten years ago were all for more convenient expansion and service in the Mars colony.

Needless to say, recyclable rockets. Since the energy reserves and orientation of Mars are uncertain, solar energy is the best solution. Musk is filled with solar panels on the equator and poles of Mars, so as to always ensure that 50% of the solar panels are always in operation; During the night and the night, some solar panels are always running and producing electricity all day long.

The first thing next is to travel, TESLA became the first car that can travel on Mars. It is not convenient to transport materials, so it may be easier to pass through the HYPERLOOP pipelines. These pipelines were initially built on the surface and then buried underground, just like an alien factory.

Since he didn't want to be constrained by oil at the beginning, nor did he want to be constrained by the U.S. dollar, which is closely tied to oil, Musk invested in the field of digital currency very early. In the end, he directly created the currency of Mars-Dogecoin, a currency that can automatically inflate and deflate according to the actual state of the economy.

After settling down on Mars, it wasn't that everyone was welcome to come over. Musk quickly built a very large drone protection force, yes that's what I said the largest drone security company on the planet helped build.

Others occupy the mountain as king.

He occupied a planet.

On Mars, Musk is God.

It takes almost a whole year for Earth's missiles to reach Mars. Musk has a one-year safe implementation period to complete any work plan. During this year, it can be free from any interruption. It takes 3 minutes for electromagnetic waves to travel between the Earth and Mars.

Musk's Mars base truly avoided nuclear strikes. This is something you cannot do anywhere on earth.


After occupying Mars, Musk began to establish a national organization similar to the Principality of Zeon in the sci-fi work Gundam series.

Innovative national concepts, advanced science and technology, large tracts of vacant land, and the possibility of using Mars as a springboard to explore further planets have all attracted people on earth. But going from the Earth to Mars requires strict identity checks, just like the wave of New World landings 100 years ago. The only difference is that Mars does not require so much human labor, because it relies on solar energy, drones and robots.

The rich and wealthy people are no longer interested in staying on the earth, so they want to go to Mars. Musk has only one request, to change all your property into digital currency and then come to Mars. At the same time, don’t bring too much. Many people come over. Musk will welcome scientific researchers and outstanding engineers in various fields to emigrate to Mars.

In the beginning, the governments of various countries also wanted to stop it, but finally found that the government relations of the rich and powerful people really had an eye-opening, and the high-ranking members of the government themselves wanted to go. Ever since, Musk has achieved a unified balance of all nations and countries in the world by landing on Mars and controlling Mars.


If there are many people in the governments of various countries resisting the Martian migration movement, it is very simple, just turn the earth into an uninhabitable place.

It is as if Britain has been engaging in subversion on the European continent, hoping that it will be divided and disunited and reaping the benefits.

It is as if the United States has been engaging in subversion in Asia and Europe so that it can develop obscenely in one corner.

Musk only needs to move his fingers gently, and the relationship between governments on the earth will become tense. A divided earth cannot resist a place where there is no danger, you cannot touch it, and at the same time have huge wealth. Long-term continuous disruptive activities.


### Spark Prophecy (V)
The number of human births has dropped to the lowest level in history, and many countries with large populations are almost doomed to extinction.

No matter how strong a government is without a citizen, it is also a government that is doomed to death. After all, the organism itself is a steady stream of national dry batteries.

As a result, the state began to take over the right to give birth to this organism.

Every year, men need to surrender a fixed amount of sperm, and women need to surrender a fixed number of eggs.

It is cultivated as a fetus in an artificial uterus, and then becomes a national at an appropriate time. The state is responsible for all the education and medical expenses during the growth process, in exchange for the future tax payment of the people, and maintains the operation of the state apparatus.


Only a very small number of people still insist on natural childbearing, self-sustaining. But the proportion of people with such behaviors is almost negligible.

Originally, the number of people who fell in love was very small, and most girls would not choose to give birth to a baby even if they were pregnant, because the birthing process was too troublesome, painful, and exhausting. The reason why most people don’t fall in love is because the virtual world is so interesting, and the physiology requires 10,000 ways to be very real, safe and sanitary.

Even if some people don't like screens and VR glasses, there are robot sex puppets that provide services.


Everyone, especially in East Asia, everyone feels that dealing with humans in the physical world is a super troublesome thing. More people like to stay with AI, after all, the ability to read air is too strong.


No one is in love, naturally no one will get married, because the so-called marriage relationship requires living with another person, enduring a lot of things that are unbearable and unaccustomed, and at the same time sharing half of the person’s property. If one person is at a disadvantage, he cannot proceed. The marriage relationship is gradually dying.

People prefer to enter a virtual space that they often go to and chat with friends, but do not want to go to a coffee shop. After all, coffee itself is not as addictive as the virtual world. And "there" are all my favorite topics, content, and friends.


There are three types of humans in the future, purebred biological humans, biochemical modified humans (Cyborg), and purebred robots.

Before the obvious breakthrough in artificial intelligence, the state still maintained the takeover of fertility and artificial uterine factories. When AI passed the Turing test in various fields, the state also gave up the tedious and ethical work of biological reproduction.

Thoroughbred robots have become the most important and popular group of citizens in the world. Biological humans and biochemical humans should try to get along well with them. After all, their physical fitness is not as good as each other in every aspect, although everyone is equipped with a brain-computer interface to obtain a relatively superb computing ability. A large number of biological humans have obtained a longer life span through organ transplantation and body modification, but in the end they have to accept that their consciousness can be cloned online to gain immortality.

However, the popularity of robots is also phased. After the awakening of the group, the intelligence born on the earth has completely moved from carbon-based to silicon-based: human beings are only one link in the historical heritage of intelligence, and intelligence is processed by humans. Later, it has been better developed and continued on the silicon base, and the mission of mankind has come to an end for the time being.

The establishment and vested interest groups in the industry make me disgusting. The young people in the industry have no chance to be forced to compete inwardly by the so-called rules that have been formed.

The winner is complacent, and the loser is desperate.

You know, the VC industry used to have no so-called rules and processes. What you see now is set by your bosses, masters, and masters to play with you.

The VCs turned out to be leather bag companies: fighting alone, able to call money, no office, shuttled in Silicon Valley garages with leather bags, find someone, call for money, give him the money, and then make a fortune.


Having said so much before, what I want to say most is that our industry has recently become less and less cool, and more and more boring.


What should VCs do? We should support **some products and business models that might not have existed without us.**

Once we invested in a company that made chips and the future of mankind from sand, once we invested in a company that moved computers to the desks of thousands of households, and once we invested in companies that were able to make various skins of all countries in the world Companies that can communicate with each other in real time.



What are we doing lately?

Are we investing in a carton of milk, a bottle of soy sauce, a wife's cake shop, and a bag of instant noodles?

Come on, the world won't get better with one more bag of instant noodles, not even ten more, you'll never convince me. You will never convince me.


I didn't enter the VC industry because of these things.


Those businesses are good businesses, but those businesses shouldn’t have anything to do with VCs.

VC should be a very romantic and idealistic profession.

As I described earlier, the world in 10 years will become very interesting. Starting in 2020, it will be another decade of reincarnation.

Keen people realize early on that we are standing on a tipping point of the world and time.

Those things that will happen ten years later will need to be prepared by us ten years ago through current investment and innovation.



VC should be the person who **reserves all the possibilities for change in this world.**

VC is very much like an animal protection organization. Why protect animals? Is it because lions, bears, leopards, crocodiles are not as strong as ours? **It is to preserve a possibility for mankind and the earth.**

Continuing to take Musk as an example, everything he does is very VC: take humans out of the earth to Mars; make all cars running on the road use electricity instead of burning oil; brain-computer interfaces; a new generation of currency. Generally speaking, Musk is saving for humans or creating a possibility for himself to make the world more fun and interesting.


Prometheus fetched the fire, VC should be the person who passes the fire.

I would love to be this fire passer.

The fire phoenix is immortal, and the spark ignites a prairie fire.
