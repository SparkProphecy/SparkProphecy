### **Starfire Prophecy (I)**

Binance will seize the stock exchange and thus the entire financial system in several steps:

① Like synthetix and mirror, "overcollateralization" with a basket of virtual currencies (similar to CDRs), mapping real-world stocks (like bTSLA), using algorithms to automatically rivet prices and then dynamically adjust the value of the collateral. This way, people who buy bTSLA are not buying air

② Allow real-world stockholders to obtain shares issued by Coinan by pledging them (e.g. pledging TSLA for bTSLA)

③ Because Binance holds real TSLA shares, Binance can also gradually allow bTSLA holders to exchange real-world TSLA within a manageable amount

④ After doing ② and ③, the pricing power and price fixing mechanism will gradually change from TSLA-dominated to bTSLA-dominated due to the nature of 24-hour trading without intermediaries and human intervention in the blockchain space. Hedge funds are forced to split their positions to bTSLA to smooth out and share the risk

⑤ After the first interconnection between the real world and the virtual coin world is completed, Binance replicates the practice to stocks with high trading volume and good liquidity, such as FANMG

⑥ After the demonstration effect, Binance allowed unlisted companies to IPO directly on Binance. After that there is no more NYSE, Nasdaq and Hong Kong Stock Exchange whatsoever, and A shares are not worth mentioning anymore

Coinbase debuting on NASDAQ today is just the result of some of the blockchain world being recruited by the mainstream world. The real Native Blockchainer doesn't bother integrating into the existing old financial system full of vested interest groups and the establishment.

In fact, they have long completed the construction of a new world: what you don't see is that GrayScale's management scale has reached $50 billion, and DCG behind it is even larger. It's just the traditional circle of people that are still blind.

No one sees the elephant in the room. They cast aside their eyes to deliberately try not to see, pretending that nothing has happened.

One day, these same people will be trampled to death by those elephants in the room.

### **Starfire Prophecy (II)**

What will the world look like in 10 years? Let us dare to imagine. 

Self-driving should have become popular, so now the Uber drivers I greet every day would have lost their jobs and wonder what they will do. A platform-level company for self-driving would be born, which would be responsible for automatically deploying vehicles and controlling the movement of various vehicles. Roads would thus become clear and the time it takes to go point-to-point in cities would be drastically reduced. This leads to an increase in the price of the land and houses left around the city, as it may have taken an hour and a half to get there because of traffic jams, but now it only takes 50 minutes. Based on this transportation platform company, car manufacturers will either be integrated into the platform; or provide personalized vehicles to complete the differentiation of driving scenarios. The interior of a self-driving car feels like a small room or a small conference room with a smoother ride for entertainment and office work. There are very large screens and better sound systems.

In a 10-year cycle, we probably won't see any delivery men and couriers anymore, drones and robot dogs should replace most of the jobs in the city's delivery service. If you don't believe me, take a look at Boston Dynamics' robots in 2010 and think about what they become in 2020. And then think about what they'll be in 2030.

People in blockchain don't believe in anything human, they only believe in code, and machines manipulated by code. So you can't convince a blockchain tycoon to hire a human bodyguard or a human nanny. Small drone security companies have also been around for a long time, with drones roughly the size of the palm of your hand, or even smaller, but can fly around clusters of 20 to 30 people, can fly in very complex formations, and perform both defensive and offensive operations. These security companies often accept payment in digital currency from anonymous addresses and have on-call services, with tarmacs in various parts of the city. The small shuttles are extremely fast, and although they also carry weapons, attacking with collisions seems to be the most effective and quickest way to end a fight.

Because drones are just so much more efficient, the government compromised to open up the skies. Cities need to re-engineer the network of skies to ensure the proper operation of drones, with protective layers erected above important buildings and office and living areas to prevent drones from falling on people. Of course drones themselves have come a long way in 10 years, and at the very least they fly or "sound" safer.

Of course, commuting to work is no longer preferred, you can work from home and it's even better than working on-site. On your glasses or contact lenses and desktop, 3D holographic projection can be made more realistic for you to feel that you and your colleagues are working together "in person", and can more easily enter the same environment and atmosphere. If you need to, you can buy skin or rejuvenation filters that at the very least keep you in the same physical condition you were in when you presented yourself as a 30-year-old for a very long time. Some kids like to appear in the workplace with a virtual identity and avatar, which is fine if the company allows it. 

The company's daily clock-in procedure is to find a way to confirm that you are "you" and need to associate the virtual image with yourself in terms of biometric characteristics. Otherwise, there will always be other human substitutes and artificial intelligence substitutes.

Of course, the company may not be a company, but a community, or a team. You can come and go at any time, everyone is assigned according to their work, and everyone's contribution is made clear through an algorithm. The goal of most companies and organizations is to develop a distributed program or functionality based on blockchain as the underlying infrastructure: no specific servers, no specific storage bandwidth or computation. AWS is long gone, replaced by ETH (computation), FIL (storage) and THETA (bandwidth) and their derivative projects respectively.

There is no such thing as a major shareholder or company owner who is the biggest beneficiary of the features and programs developed, either; anyone involved in the network who contributes will benefit from the development of the network itself. Any content, even if it is not the leading one, is rewarded as long as it makes a small contribution to the development and expansion of the network, and many people make a living from it.

Users are shareholders, and there is no longer a crappy business model where software forces users to hand over their data to be used for advertising. Users either pay their own monthly fees for features, or are rewarded for contributing content and value to the network against their monthly fees. The community itself encourages this behavior.

Everyone knows that their data is sacrosanct, as sacred as private property as defined by statute 200 years ago. After all, it is the only proof that you are "you" living in Cyberspace.

### **Starfire Prophecy (III)**

No one's money is in the bank, and we are once again back to the state of knowing clearly that "my money is mine" and that it really belongs to me.

Unless someone uses magic on me or a truth-telling potion and I reveal my private key, I will not reveal the private key stored in my mind even if I am forced to do so. The money is there, it's "mine", and no one can take it away. And most people don't actually know that I have this money.

The efficiency of blockchain has increased 1000 times in a 10-year cycle, and a transaction that was 1 minute is now done in 0.06 seconds. So it is possible to complete rapid transfer and confirmation operations now. We are not only grateful to the improvement of algorithms and data structures, but also to the continuous advancement of chip technology that will enhance computational efficiency, and improve storage and transmission.

We can easily lend, mortgage, and trade assets without the need for human intermediaries. Most of the contracts are set up in smart contracts.

From the first grade onwards, we require our children to learn programming in addition to foreign languages, otherwise they won't even know how to sign a contract with someone when they enter into society. If you don't know code, you'll be screwed over easily, just like the illiterate people in the old days.

It seems like our children also do not need to go to school, after all, all the knowledge existed on the Internet since a long time ago, and with little guidance from teachers, everyone can learn what they need to know relatively easily and conveniently.

In the world of finance, there is also no information gap between people, and most good ideas are known by everyone at the beginning of the first round of funding, so getting an investment opportunity is not as simple as offering to fund it. More people are chosen as investors because they do understand the project and what the community is trying to do and have the ability to help out, and many people bid, with both large and small funds involved. The IPO of the project is from day one, and together the crowd has more strength. Investors will know all about the team's daily cash flow and that a good team needs to go through heavy temptations, trials and tribulations.

### **Starfire Prophecy (IV)**

Humans built a test version one of Mars colony base, but more importantly, the lunar base was completed before that.

Just because we were able to reach Mars for exploration does not mean that the first extraterrestrial base was built on Mars.

Asteroid mining has become a common occurrence, and there is no more shortage of all kinds of rare metals that are not available on Earth.

That first version of the Mars colony base undoubtedly belongs to Musk, and it was soon discovered that all the technologies Musk developed and drilled a decade ago were designed to make it easier to expand and serve in the Mars colony.

Recoverable rockets were created. Since Mars' energy reserves and orientation are uncertain, solar power is the best solution. Musk has stacked solar panels at the equator and poles of Mars so that 50% of the panels are always running; there is always a portion of solar panels running around the clock during its extreme days and nights to produce electricity.

The next that came was mobility, and TESLA became the first vehicle that could drive on Mars. Transporting supplies is not easy, so it may be easier to go through the HYPERLOOP pipeline, which is initially built on the surface, and then buried underground, like in the Factorio.

Not wanting to be held back by oil from the start, or by the dollar, which is tied so closely to oil, Musk got into digital currency early on. He eventually went straight to creating Mars' currency, Dogecoin, a currency that can automatically inflate and deflate based on the state of the actual economy.

After settling on Mars, it is not a case of welcoming everyone over. Musk quickly built a very large drone protection force, and yes, that largest drone security company on Earth I mentioned previously.

Others occupy land.

He takes over a planet.

On Mars, Musk is God.

It takes almost a full year for Earth's missiles to hit Mars, and Musk has a safe implementation period of one year to complete any work plan, during which he can be left undisturbed. Electromagnetic waves take 3 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars.

Musk's Mars base has truly avoided a nuclear strike. That's something you can't do anywhere on Earth.

After occupying Mars, Musk began to build a national organization similar to the Principality of Zeon in the science fiction Gundam series.

Innovative national concepts, advanced science and technology, vast areas of free land, and the possibility of using Mars as a springboard to explore more distant planets have made Earthlings swoon. But going to Mars from Earth requires strict identity checks, just like the New World immigration wave 100 years ago, except that Mars does not require as much manual labor because it is all about solar power, drones and robots.

Rich people are no longer interested in staying on Earth, they want to take their families to Mars, Musk has only two requests, convert all your property into digital currency and don't bring too many people over. Musk will be more than welcome to have various fields of scientific research workers and excellent engineers to immigrate to Mars.

At first the governments wanted to stop it, but finally realized that the government relations of the rich and powerful are unstoppable, and the high-ranking members of the government themselves also want to go. So, Musk landed on Mars and his control of Mars achieved the balance of all races and nations in the world.

If governments and a lot of people are still resisting the Mars immigration movement, it's also simple enough to turn Earth into an uninhabitable planet.

As if Britain had been engaging in subversion on the European continent, hoping that it would be divided and disunited while they sit back and reap the benefits.

As if the United States has been engaging in subversion in Asia and Europe so that it can develop obscenely on the side.

Musk only needs to lift a finger, and the relationship between the governments of the planet will be in turmoil. The divided planet cannot resist the long-term sustained subversive activities of a person in a safe environment with tremendous wealth.

### **Starfire Prophecy (V)**

Human births are at an all-time low, and many populous nations are nearly doomed to extinction.

A strong government without its people is a government that is doomed to die. After all, the people themselves are a constant source for the national dry cell.

Thus, the state began to take over the right to reproduce as an organism.

Every year men are required to surrender a fixed amount of sperm and women are required to surrender a fixed number of eggs.

The fetus is nurtured in an artificial womb and delivered in due course to become a citizen. The state is responsible for all the costs of education and medical care during the upbringing in exchange for the future taxation of the nationals and the maintenance of the state apparatus.

Only very few people still insist on natural reproduction and raise their own children. The percentage of people who behave in this way is almost negligible.

The number of people who are in a relationship is very limited, most of the teenage girls even if they are pregnant will not choose to give birth, because the birth process is too much trouble, too painful and exhausting. Most people do not fall in love for the reason that the virtual world is too interesting, and that there are 10,000 ways to solve the physical needs which are all very real, safe and hygienic.

Even if someone does not like screen and VR glasses, there are robotic sex partners to provide services. 

Everyone, especially in East Asia, finds it a hassle to get along and deal with humans in the physical world. More people like to stay with AI, after all, their ability to observe humans' needs is extraordinary.

With no one falling in love, naturally no one will get married, because the so-called marriage relationship requires living with another person, enduring a large number of things that can not be tolerated enough to get used to, and at the same time having to share half of your property with this person, there will always be one person who is at a disadvantage in this matter, and thus it will not be possible to proceed. The marimonial relationship will gradually die out.

People would rather enter some virtual space they often visit and chat with their friends than go to a coffee shop. After all, coffee itself is not as addictive as the virtual world. And the virtual world has all their favorite topics, content and friends.

People in the future are divided into three kinds, pure biological people, biochemically modified people (Cyborg), and purebred robots.

The state maintains its takeover of fertility and artificial womb factories until there was a clear breakthrough in AI, and once AI passed the Turing test in every field, the state abandoned the tedious and morally reprehensible job of biological fertility as well. 

Purebred robots became the most important and most popular group of citizens for the government. Both pure biological people and biochemically modified people had to try to get along with them, after all, their physical qualities are inferior in all aspects, even with each of them being equipped with a brain-computer interface to obtain a relatively high level of computing power. A large number of biochemically modified people gained a longer life span through organ transplants and body modifications, but in the end had to accept cloning their consciousness online to gain immortality.

However, the popularity of robots is also just a stage, after all, after the awakening, the intelligence born on earth has thoroughly moved from carbon-based to silicon-based: human beings are just a link in the historical heritage of intelligence, intelligence after human processing, in which a silicon base gets better development and continuation. As such, the mission of human beings has come to a temporary end.

The industry's establishment and vested interest groups make me sick to my stomach, and the industry's young people have no opportunity: they are forced into involution by the so-called rules that have been formed.

Winners gloat; losers lose their minds.

It is important to know that the VC industry did not have those so-called rules and processes, everything you see now are set up by your bosses, masters and superiors.

VCs were originally bogus companies: single-handed, able to get money, no office, carrying purses traveling through the garages of Silicon Valley, finding people, getting money, giving people the money, and then getting rich.

With so much said, what I am really trying to say is that our industry is also getting less cool and more boring lately.

What should VCs be doing? **They should be supporting products and business models that probably wouldn't exist without us.**

Once we invested in companies that built chips and the future of humanity out of sand. Once we invested in companies that brought computers to the desks of millions of homes; we invested in companies that enabled countries of the world of all colors and languages to communicate with each other in real time.

But what are we doing these days?

We're investing in a box of milk, a bottle of soy sauce, a cake store, a bag of instant noodles? 

Come on, the world won't get better with one more bag of instant noodles, not even ten more, you'll never convince me. There's no way you'll ever convince me. 

I didn't get into the VC business because of those things. 

Those businesses are good businesses, but those businesses shouldn't be associated with VCs in the first place. 

VC is supposed to be a very romantic and idealistic profession.

As I described earlier, the world is going to be a very interesting place in 10 years, starting in 2020 with the reincarnation of a new decade.

Astute people realize early on that we stand at a tipping point in the world and in time.

Those things that are going to happen in ten years need to be prepared by us ten years ago by investing and innovating in the present. 

VCs are supposed to be people who **preserve the possibilities of change for the world.**

VCs are a lot like animal protection organizations. Why do you want to protect animals? Is it because lions, bears, leopards and crocodiles are not as strong as we are? It is to **preserve a possibility for human beings and the earth.** 

Continuing with Musk's example, everything he is doing is very VC: taking humans off the planet to Mars; getting all cars running on the road to use electricity instead of oil; brain-computer interfaces; a new generation of currency. Overall, Musk is all about preserving or creating for himself the possibility of making the world a more fun and interesting place for humanity.

Prometheus fetched the fire, VC should be the person who passes the fire.

I would love to be the fire passer.

The phoenix does not die; a little spark can start a prairie fire.
